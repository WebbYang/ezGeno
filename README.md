# ezGeno
Implementation of an efficient neuronal architecture search algorithms for predicting transcription factor binding sites from ChIP-seq data.

The repository contains a flexible pytorch implementation of a eNAS algorithm, where parameteres can be altered and adjusted by users. The basic architecture and idea was built based on DeepBind (https://github.com/kundajelab/deepbind).
